            <h1>Mars</h1>
            <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. Befitting the Red Planet's bloody color, the Romans named it after their god of war. 
                In truth, the Romans copied the ancient Greeks, who also named the planet after their god of war, Ares. Other civilizations 
                also typically gave the planet names based on its color — for example, the Egyptians named it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one," 
                while ancient Chinese astronomers dubbed it "the fire star."</p>
            <p>An engineer working on NASA's Mars 2020 mission uses a solar intensity probe to measure and compare the amount of artificial 
                sunlight that reaches different portions of the rover. To simulate the Sun's rays for the test, powerful xenon lamps several 
                floors below the chamber were illuminated, their light directed onto a mirror at the top of the chamber and reflected down on 
                the spacecraft. The data collected during this test will be used to confirm thermal models the team has generated regarding how 
                the Sun's rays will interact with the 2020 rover while on the surface of Mars.</p>
            <p>About 984 feet (300 meters) behind the rover is Vera Rubin Ridge, which Curiosity departed nearly a year ago. Beyond the ridge, you 
                can see the floor of Gale Crater and the crater's northern rim. Curiosity has been ascending Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) 
                mountain inside the crater.The special chemistry experiment occurred on Sept. 24, 2019, after the rover placed the powderized sample from 
                Glen Etive 2 into SAM. The portable lab contains 74 small cups used for testing samples. Most of the cups function as miniature ovens that 
                heat the samples; SAM then "sniffs" the gases that bake off, looking for chemicals that hold clues about the Martian environment billions 
                of years ago, when the planet was friendlier to microbial life.</p>
